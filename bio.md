I am a third year D.Phil. (Ph.D.) student in the [Machine Learning Research Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/)
at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Michael A Osborne](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/) and [Tom Rainforth](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~twgr/). My D.Phil. is fully funded through a Oxford - [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) Graduate Scholarship.

My research interests are quite broad: the main topics include but are not limited to Gaussian Processes, Deep Learning and Probabilistic Generative Modeling. As much as I like researching, I am really keen about applying machine learning to real world problems and improving everyday lives.

Before moving to Oxford, I got an M.Sc. in [Computational Science and Engineering](http://www.rw.ethz.ch/) from [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), where I specialized in computational physics and wrote my master thesis on medical applications of machine learning and deep learning methods ("Surgical Prediction for Lumbar Spine Stenosis"), supervised by [Joachim Buhmann](http://www.ise.inf.ethz.ch/). This work yielded a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07137) published at [MICCAI 2017](http://www.miccai2017.org/).

During my time in Switzerland I also interned as a computational scientist at the [CSCS](http://www.cscs.ch/) (Swiss National Supercomputing Center) in Lugano, where I helped in a research effort aimed at GPU-porting the [RAMSES](http://www.ics.uzh.ch/~teyssier/ramses/RAMSES.html) code. You can read my [interview](http://www.cscs.ch/index.php?id=1528) about it.

Before moving to Zürich I got my B.Eng. in Mathematical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/en/home/).

Parallel to Machine Learning, I have several passions: depending on the season, you can find me snowboarding, surfing or boxing. While at Oxford, I competed twice in the Varsity Boxing against Cambridge and I was the [OUABC](https://www.ouabc.com/) president in 2018/2019.
