I am a third year D.Phil. (Ph.D.) student in the [Machine Learning Research Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/)
at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Michael A Osborne](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/). My D.Phil. is fully funded for its whole duration by a Oxford - [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) Graduate Scholarship.

My research interests are quite broad, the main topics being Gaussian Processes, Deep Learning and lately Causality. As much as I like researching, I am really keen about applying machine learning to real world problems and improving everyday life.

Before my D.Phil., I got my M.Sc. in [Computational Science and Engineering](http://www.rw.ethz.ch/) from [ETH Zürich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), where I specialized in computational physics and wrote my master thesis on medical applications of machine learning and deep learning methods ("Surgical Prediction for Lumbar Spine Stenosis"), supervised by [Joachim Buhmann](http://www.ise.inf.ethz.ch/). This work yielded a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07137) published at [MICCAI 2017](http://www.miccai2017.org/).

During my MSc I also interned as a computational scientist at the [CSCS](http://www.cscs.ch/) (Swiss National Supercomputing Center) in Lugano, where I helped in a research effort aimed at GPU-porting the [RAMSES](http://www.ics.uzh.ch/~teyssier/ramses/RAMSES.html) code. You can read an [interview](http://www.cscs.ch/index.php?id=1528) of mine describing the experience.  
For one semester I was also hired by ETH as teaching assistant ("Stochastics").

Before moving to Zürich I got my B.Eng. in Mathematical Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/en/home/).
