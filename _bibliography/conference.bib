  abstract = 	 {Stochastic differential equations are an important modeling class in many disciplines. Consequently, there exist many methods relying on various discretization and numerical integration schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel, probabilistic model for estimating the drift and diffusion given noisy observations of the underlying stochastic system. Using state-of-the-art adversarial and moment matching inference techniques, we avoid the discretization schemes of classical approaches. This leads to significant improvements in parameter accuracy and robustness given random initial guesses. On four established benchmark systems, we compare the performance of our algorithms to state-of-the-art solutions based on extended Kalman filtering and Gaussian processes.}

  abstract = "Gradient-based optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling can be found at the heart of several machine learning methods. In high-dimensional settings, well-known issues such as slow-mixing, non-convexity and correlations can hinder the algorithms' efficiency. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose AdaGeo, a preconditioning framework for adaptively learning the geometry of the parameter space during optimization or sampling. In particular, we use the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) to represent a lower-dimensional embedding of the parameters, identifying the underlying Riemannian manifold on which the optimization or sampling is taking place. Samples or optimization steps are consequently proposed based on the geometry of the manifold. We apply our framework to stochastic gradient descent, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and stochastic gradient Riemannian Langevin dynamics, and show performance improvements for both optimization and sampling.",

abstract="The most common reason for spinal surgery in elderly patients is lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). For LSS, treatment decisions based on clinical and radiological information as well as personal experience of the surgeon show large variance. Thus a standardized support system is of high value for a more objective and reproducible decision. In this work, we develop an automated algorithm to localize the stenosis causing the symptoms of the patient in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With 22 MRI features of each of five spinal levels of 321 patients, we show it is possible to predict the location of lesion triggering the symptoms. To support this hypothesis, we conduct an automated analysis of labeled and unlabeled MRI scans extracted from 788 patients. We confirm quantitatively the importance of radiological information and provide an algorithmic pipeline for working with raw MRI scans.
