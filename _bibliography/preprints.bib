  abstract={Stochastic differential equations are an important modeling class in many disciplines. Consequently, there exist many methods relying on various discretization and numerical integration schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel, probabilistic model for estimating the drift and diffusion given noisy observations of the underlying stochastic system. Using state-of-the-art adversarial and moment matching inference techniques, we circumvent the use of the discretization schemes as seen in classical approaches. This yields significant improvements in parameter estimation accuracy and robustness given random initial guesses. On four commonly used benchmark systems, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms compared to state-of-the-art solutions based on extended Kalman filtering and Gaussian processes.}

  abstract={Parameter inference in ordinary differential equations is an important problem in many applied sciences and in engineering, especially in a data-scarce setting. In this work, we introduce a novel generative modeling approach based on constrained Gaussian processes and use it to create a computationally and data efficient algorithm for state and parameter inference. In an extensive set of experiments, our approach outperforms its competitors both in terms of accuracy and computational cost for parameter inference. It also shows promising results for the much more challenging problem of model selection.}

  abstract={Time series forecasting is ubiquitous in the modern world. Applications range from health care to astronomy, include climate modelling, financial trading and monitoring of critical engineering equipment. To offer value over this range of activities we must have models that not only provide accurate forecasts but that also quantify and adjust their uncertainty over time. Furthermore, such models must allow for multimodal, non-Gaussian behaviour that arises regularly in applied settings. In this work, we propose a novel, end-to-end deep learning method for time series forecasting. Crucially, our model allows the principled assessment of predictive uncertainty as well as providing rich information regarding multiple modes of future data values. Our approach not only provides an excellent predictive forecast, shadowing true future values, but also allows us to infer valuable information, such as the predictive distribution of the occurrence of critical events of interest, accurately and reliably even over long time horizons. We find the method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Gaussian Processes. }
